This is a repository for my master thesis work carried out in the autumn of 2022. I will implement the two protocols proposed in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-97121-2_8). The subject is within cryptography, and even more specifically multi party computation (MPC).
